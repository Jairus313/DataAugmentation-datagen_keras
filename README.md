# DataAugmentation using datagen-keras frameworks

**This is code for augmenting the image dataset using DataGenerator from keras frameworks**

The ipython notebook and images here are used in the my article called **“Data Augmentation-CNN(Keras)” in nutshell [Code]** which is published in [AnalyticsVidhya Medium Publication](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya)

The code snippets here explains the ways the image data that can be augmented by filping, rotationg, zooming, tuning the brightness and so on.
